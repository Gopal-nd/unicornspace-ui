  Focus on what matters, not UI, boilerplate code, clumsy documentation. Leave that on us. Get inspired, plan, create great web pages

UnicornSpaceUI is a collection of re-usable components that you can copy
and paste into your web apps.

## Why we started this

Our goal of the project is to `save your time`, as 90% of the time you'll be using components and designs that are similar to what you might or others on the internet have build previously, then why should you waste your time to reinvent the wheel.

## Where will UnicornSpaceUI help you & save your time?

- You no longer need to go in search of inspiration, go through tens of website to find it, we got all here.
- You no longer need to go through clumsy documentations to figure out how to integrate auth, payments, technologies and much more, instead use our easy to follow along [/guides](/guides)
- We're saving your time from finding designs for inspiration to selecting good fonts, colors, layouts to building the product, optimizing it to production.
- We've got bunch of tools to help you fasttrack you're workflow in design and development
- This is a perfect place for you incase you lack design, we've got you covered you can learn design, typography, UI, UX principles, tried & tested UI to get things to function.
- and much more...

## Whom is this UnicornSpaceUI for?

1. SAAS owners
2. Individual Developers
3. Indie Hackers
4. Companies looking to pace up
5. Developers who lack design.

## Why we started?

There are lots of `UI libraries` out there, but we belived there a lot to be covered and they have missed out, they might be good for foundations but in real life things are just beyond that basic UI, you need better design, better layouts, faster growth, you don't want yourself to be stuck in the repeatative part, you just want to get things done and work on the crux of the problem you're trying to solve.

## Who are we?

We are a team from [UnicornSpace](https://www.unicornspace.tech/) company, on a daily basis we have gone through these problems ourself and that is why we built UnicornSpaceUI to fix this

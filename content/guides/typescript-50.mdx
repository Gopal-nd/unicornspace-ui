# Typescript

what is difference between `?.` and `!.`?

```ts
object?.name;
object!.name;
```

DOUBT: what is dispatchedSignIn & dispatchedLogIn in the course?
-> may be for the errors handling.

## Omit

Omit constructs a type by picking all properties from **Type** and then removing Keys (string literal or union of string literals).

```tsx
type Pet = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type Pet2 = Omit<Pet, "id">;
//    name: string;
//    age: number;
```

## How to use one value from a type

Useful because it has you're fetching from one source of truth and you need not update everywhere if you plan to change in future

```tsx
const pet: Pet["id"] = "hit";
```

# Zustand

Zustand is a small, fast and scalable bearbones state-management solution. It is a simple and straightforward library that allows you to manage the state of your application with ease. It is a great alternative to Redux and MobX.


## Installation

```terminal
pnpm add zustand
```


```tsx
import create from 'zustand'

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increasePopulation: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  removeAllBears: () => set({ bears: 0 }),
}))

```
